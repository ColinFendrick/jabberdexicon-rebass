# Jabberdexicon Rebass

![](./jabberdexicon-rebass-example.gif)

An update of an older app we built using MobX and React. This app was built using the Rebass library, by JxnBlk, available [here](http://jxnblk.com/rebass/). A great library with some skeletal components for building a user-friendly app or site.
